# Contributing to EJGEngine

Thank you for your interest in contributing to EJGEngine.  
The engine is still in active development, and contributions are appreciated, but we must maintain a stable and manageable workflow for the project.

This document outlines how contributions are handled, what type of work is accepted, and how to report issues responsibly.

<br>

## Pull Request Policy

EJGEngine does **not** accept pull requests adding new major changes from contributors outside the core project team.

We **do** accept and review PRs that:

- Fix an existing bug
- Small new features
- Address a documented issue in the issue tracker
- Improve well-defined core functionality without changing behavior

Bug fixing PRs are significantly easier to evaluate, review, and merge, and they help maintain the engine’s stability.

If you'd like to propose a new feature, please open an issue first.

<br>

## Responsible Disclosure

EJGEngine is a growing codebase with many moving parts. We aim to maintain high security standards and welcome responsible research into potential vulnerabilities.

If you discover a security-related issue:

1. **Do not disclose it publicly.**
2. Contact the development team directly by email:  
   **contact@collebol.org**
3. Include a clear description and any steps required to reproduce the issue.

If we fail to respond within **7 days**, you may disclose the issue publicly.  
This ensures we remain responsive while allowing you to responsibly share findings if we fall short.

<br>

## Issue Reporting

If you encounter bugs, crashes, unexpected behavior, or documentation problems, please open an issue on GitHub.

When reporting an issue:

- Provide clear steps to reproduce
- Include logs or error messages where applicable
- Add screenshots or GIFs for visual/UI issues
- Specify your system details (OS, Java version, etc.)

We also accept feature suggestions through GitHub issues, though not all suggestions will be added to the roadmap.

<br>

## Contact

You can reach the development team through:

- GitHub Issues (for bugs and feature suggestions)
- Email (for security disclosures or urgent matters):  
  **contact@collebol.org**

A community Discord may become available in the future as the project grows.

Thank you again for your interest in EJGEngine.
